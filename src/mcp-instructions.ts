In stdio mode, download-bytes-to-file writes those same authenticated bytes straight to a local absolute path instead of returning base64 — the only out-of-band option for large mail attachments and meeting recordings, which get-download-url cannot handle. These tools take relative Microsoft Graph paths, not absolute URLs. For uploads, upload-file-content takes a base64 string body up to 4MB; use create-upload-session above that.',
